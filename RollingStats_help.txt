Public functions:
*****************
rolling_ts(): Rolling Univariate Time-series Statistics
-------------
+ This function allows the user to compute specific statistics
in either a 'rolling' (fixed, shifting window through time) or 'recursive'
(expanding window through time) manner.
+ In principle all -- both built-in as well as user-defined functions (UDF)
-- can be called which have a scalar value as its outcome.

rvec2series(): Transforms vector into series object
--------------
+ Transforms the resulting vector from rolling_ts() into a series


-----------------
rolling_ts():
-----------------
INPUT:
series y: 			series which is used for computing some statistics
string which:		string, put into string a very specific task to do
int wsize[1::2]:	set the window-lenght (default 2 periods)
bool recursive[0]:	0: rolling-window (default), 1: recursive (expanding) window

OUTPUT: R by 1 matrix
+ Matrix includes the computed statistics for each window

-----------------
rvec2series():
-----------------
INPUT:
series y: 			series which is used for computing some statistics
matrix m:			R by 1 vector "Some vector of interest"
int wsize[1::2]:	set the window-lenght (default 2 periods)
bool recursive[0]:	0: rolling-window (default), 1: recursive (expanding) window

OUTPUT: series
+ Series of rolling/ recursively computed statistics based in 'y'
correctly aligned with time
